# MDP REPRESENTATION

## AIM:
To represent any one real-world problem in MDP form.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To develop a game application,the role of the agent is to promote the character on a quest to reach higher levels and gain rewards.

### Problem Description
{L1,L2,L3}-->{0,1,2}<br>
Develop a game application where an agent assists a character on a quest to advance through levels {L1, L2, L3} and earn rewards, with the state space represented as {0, 1, 2}.

### State Space
0,1,2

### Sample State
L2->Level2,1

### Action Space
move backward<br>
move forward

### Sample Action
move forward->character of the game reaches to higher level

### Reward Function
+1, if the character of the game reaches the next level<br>
0, Otherwise
